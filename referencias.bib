@article{Brenner1996,
abstract = {The short-term rate of interest is fundamental to much of theoretical and empirical finance, yet no consensus has emerged on the dynamics of its volatility. We show that models which parameterize volatility only as a function of interest rate levels tend to over emphasize the sensitivity of volatility to levels and fail to model adequately the serial correlation in conditional variances. On the other hand, serial correlation based models like GARCH models fail to capture adequately the relationship between interest rate levels and volatility. We introduce and test a new class of models for the dynamics of short-term interest rate volatility, which allows volatility to depend on both interest rate levels and information shocks. Two important conclusions emerge. First, the sensitivity of interest rate volatility to interest rate levels has been overstated in the literature. While this relationship is important, adequately modeling volatility as a function of unexpected information shocks is also important. Second, we conclude that the volatility processes in many existing theoretical models of interest rates are misspecified, and suggest new paths toward improving the theory.},

They illustrate the problem by reconsidering the role of contemporaneous trading volume in explaining ARCH effects in daily stock returns. Once the constraint imposed in earlier research is relaxed, it is found that specifying volume as a covariate does little to diminish the importance of lagged squared returns in capturing the dynamics of volatility. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Key Features: Presents a comprehensive overview of both the theory and the practical applications of ARCH, an increasingly popular financial modelling technique. Assumes no prior knowledge of ARCH models; the basics such as model construction are introduced, before proceeding to more complex applications such as value-at-risk, option pricing and model evaluation. Uses empirical examples to demonstrate how the recent developments in ARCH can be implemented. Provides step-by-step instructive examples, using econometric software, such as Econometric Views and the G@RCH module for the Ox software package, used in Estimating and Forecasting ARCH Models. Accompanied by a CD-ROM containing links to the software as well as the datasets used in the examples.

abstract = {The short-term rate of interest is fundamental to much of theoretical and empirical finance, yet no consensus has emerged on the dynamics of its volatility. We show that models which parameterize volatility only as a function of interest rate levels tend to over emphasize the sensitivity of volatility to levels and fail to model adequately the serial correlation in conditional variances. On the other hand, serial correlation based models like GARCH models fail to capture adequately the relationship between interest rate levels and volatility. We introduce and test a new class of models for the dynamics of short-term interest rate volatility, which allows volatility to depend on both interest rate levels and information shocks. Two important conclusions emerge. First, the sensitivity of interest rate volatility to interest rate levels has been overstated in the literature. While this relationship is important, adequately modeling volatility as a function of unexpected information shocks is also important. Second, we conclude that the volatility processes in many existing theoretical models of interest rates are misspecified, and suggest new paths toward improving the theory.},

abstract = {Excessive exchange rate volatility has a deleterious effect on international financial flows, external trade, investment and output. Among others, these economic costs prompt the central bank in emerging countries to contain excessive exchange rate volatility through intervention in the foreign exchange market. This article investigates the effectiveness of State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) daily foreign exchange intervention starting from 3 July 2000 to 31 December 2005 (1593 trading day observations). The method of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity, with exogenous variables (GARCH-X), used in this article, shows that SBP's intervention operation is very effective as it not only affects the exchange rate levels but also reduces the exchange rate volatility. It is also found that the short-term interest rate and the size of the foreign exchange reserves held by SBP also affect the exchange rate level and its volatility. Increase in short-term interest rate and higher foreign exchange reserves are associated with appreciation of exchange rate levels and vice versa. In addition, higher foreign exchange reserves also reduce the exchange rate volatility. In sharp contrast to the no days-of-the-week effects on exchange rate level, the results show that there is some evidence of significant days-of-the-week effects of intervention on exchange rate volatility. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

@article{Staikouras2006,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to examine the validity of one of the recurring arguments made against futures markets that they give rise to price instability. The paper concentrates on the impact of futures trading on the spot market volatility of short-term interest rates. The analytical framework employed is based on a new statistical approach aiming to reconcile the traditional models of short-term interest rates and the conditional volatility processes. More specifically, this class of models aims to capture the dynamics of short-term interest rate volatility by allowing volatility to depend on both scale effects and information shocks. Using a GARCH-X and asymmetric GARCH-X model four main conclusions emerge from the present study. First, the empirical results suggest that there is an indisputable change in the nature of volatility with evidence of mean reversion after the onset of futures trading. Second, the information flow into the market has improved as a result of futures trading. Third, a stabilization effect has been detected running from the futures market to the cash market by lowering volatility levels and decreasing the risk in the spot market. Finally, trying to capture the leverage effect the findings suggest that positive shocks have a greater impact on volatility than negative shocks. {\textcopyright} 2006 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.},

However, the influence of these variables is market-specific, indicating no systematic pattern across global capital markets.

@inproceedings{Tudor2011,
abstract = {This paper develops a new GARCH-family model (named Liquidity-Weighted GARCH or LW-GARCH) for explaining the volatility behaviour of financial time series, with an application on empirical international equity series (consisting both of stock market indices and individual stock returns). The dataset consists of daily stock market indexes and individual stocks closing prices (12 series) from international stock markets, both developed (USA, Japan, Western Europe) and post-transition CEE stock markets and the sample period extends from January 2, 2001 to February 19, 2008. Further, three different time intervals are delineated to comparatively estimate and compare the accuracy of three volatility models in explaining the conditional volatility of the empirical equity series, i.e. GARCH (1,1), EGARCH (1,1) and the newly developed LW-GARCH. We find that the LW- GARCH model generally performs better in explaining conditional volatility than the other two models (higher values for the log-likelihood function and lower values for the BIC information criterion). In addition, we notice that the exogenous factor in the conditional variance equation has a higher explanatory power in the more recent analysis period, therefore the influence of the explanatory factor (the S{\&}P500) has increased in recent years, so that the more recent is the time period used in the estimation, the better the LW-GARCH performs comparatively to other volatility models.},

Specifically, we consider sequential testing based on two likelihood ratio tests and as demonstrated the structure of the inverse information implies that the proposed test neither depends on whether the nuisance parameters lie on the boundary of the parameter space, nor on lack of identification. Asymptotic theory is derived essentially under stationarity and ergodicity, coupled with a regularity assumption on the exogenous covariate X.

The framework employs (V)ARMA-X representations and relies on a bias-adjustment in the log-volatility intercept. The bias is induced by (V)ARMA estimators, but the remaining parameters can be estimated in a consistent and asymptotically normal manner by usual (V)ARMA methods. An estimator of the bias and a closed-form expression for the asymptotic variance is derived. Adding covariates and/or increasing the dimension of the model does not change the structure of the problem, so the univariate bias-adjustment procedure is applicable not only in univariate log-GARCH-X models estimated by the ARMA-X representation, but also in multivariate log-GARCH-X models estimated by VARMA-X representations. Extensive simulations verify the properties of the log-moment estimator, and an empirical application illustrates the usefulness of the methods.},

abstract = {Estimation of large financial volatility models is plagued by the curse of dimensionality. As the dimension grows, joint estimation of the parameters becomes unfeasible in practice. This problem is compounded if covariates or conditioning variables (“X”) are added to each volatility equation. The problem is especially acute for non-exponential volatility models, e.g., GARCH models, since the variables and parameters in these cases are restricted to be positive. Here, we propose an estimator for a multivariate log-GARCH-X model that avoids these problems. The model allows for feedback among the equations, admits several stationary regressors as conditioning variables in the X-part (including leverage terms), and allows for time-varying conditional covariances of unknown form. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of an equation-by-equation least squares estimator are proved, and the results can be used to undertake inference both within and across equations. The flexibility and usefulness of the estimator is illustrated in two empirical applications.},

@article{Gonzalez-vanegas2019,
abstract = {Bayesian statistical inference under unknown or hard to asses likelihood functions is a very challenging task. Currently, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) techniques have emerged as a widely used set of likelihood-free methods. A vast number of ABC-based approaches have appeared in the literature; however, they all share a hard dependence on free parameters selection, demanding expensive tuning procedures. In this paper, we introduce an automatic kernel learning-based ABC approach, termed AKL-ABC, to automatically compute posterior estimations from a weighting-based inference. To reach this goal, we propose a kernel learning stage to code similarities between simulation and parameter spaces using a centered kernel alignment (CKA) that is automated via an Information theoretic learning approach. Besides, a local neighborhood selection (LNS) algorithm is used to highlight local dependencies over simulations relying on graph theory. Attained results on synthetic and real-world datasets show our approach is a quite competitive method compared to other non-automatic state-of-the-art ABC techniques.},

@article{Voutilainen2018,
abstract = {Stationary processes have been extensively studied in the literature. Their applications include modelling and forecasting numerous real life phenomena such as natural disasters, sales and market movements. When stationary processes are considered, modelling is traditionally based on fitting an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. However, we challenge this conventional approach. Instead of fitting an ARMA model, we apply an AR(1) characterization in modelling any strictly stationary processes. Moreover, we derive consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of the corresponding model parameter.},

abstract = {Summary This paper derives the ARMA representation of integrated and realized var ances when the spot variance depends linearly on two autoregressive factors, i.e. SR-SARV(2 models. This class of processes includes affine, GARCH diffusion, and CEV models, as wel as the eigenfunction stochastic volatility and the positive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. W also study the leverage effect case, and the relationship between the weak GARCH represen tation of returns and the ARMA representation of realized variances. Finally, various empir ical implications of these ARMA representations are considered. We find that it is possible that some parameters of the ARMA representation are negative. Hence, the positiveness of the expected values of integrated or realized variances is not guaranteed. We also find that fo some frequencies of observations, the continuous time model parameters may be weakly or not identified through the ARMA representation of realized variances.},

  abstract        = {Most financial and investment decisions are based on considerations of possible future changes and require forecasts on the evolution of the financial world. Time series and processes are the natural tools for describing the dynamic behavior of financial data, leading to the required forecasts. This book presents a survey of the empirical properties of financial time series, their descriptions by means of mathematical processes, and some implications for important financial applications used in many areas like risk evaluation, option pricing or portfolio construction. The statistical tools used to extract information from raw data are introduced. Extensive multiscale empirical statistics provide a solid benchmark of stylized facts (heteroskedasticity, long memory, fat-tails, leverage{\ldots}), in order to assess various mathematical structures that can capture the observed regularities. The author introduces a broad range of processes and evaluates them systematically against the benchmark, summarizing the successes and limitations of these models from an empirical point of view. The outcome is that only multiscale ARCH processes with long memory, discrete multiplicative structures and non-normal innovations are able to capture correctly the empirical properties. In particular, only a discrete time series framework allows to capture all the stylized facts in a process, whereas the stochastic calculus used in the continuum limit is too constraining. The present volume offers various applications and extensions for this class of processes including high-frequency volatility estimators, market risk evaluation, covariance estimation and multivariate extensions of the processes. The book discusses many practical implications and is addressed to practitioners and quants in the financial industry, as well as to academics, including graduate (Master or PhD level) students. The prerequisites are basic statistics and some elementary financial mathematics.},
